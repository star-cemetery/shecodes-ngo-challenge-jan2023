            Being fascinated by fairy tales about people talking to animals, I
            have always considered the latter creatures higher than people in
            terms of perception, instincts and performance. Cows have been an
            especially magnificent and enigmatic creatures to me, whose wisdom
            yet I am incapable of comprehending. I consider them as sacred as
            all the other animals, still they take a special corner in my heart. I dream that one day all animals
            considered "farm"/"domestic"/etc. will be treated as best friends,
            wise and compassinate companions and will live free roam, healthy
            and happy till the day Death comes to take their souls to Heavenly Father.

              <br />
              <br />Life of industrial animals is appaling from every angle - life conditions, life expectancy, food given to them, human attitude, their early and painful death, etc. Those interested can find all the statistics/visuals/proofs needed to see the scale of this disaster called "dairy/meat industry". The most courageous or emotionally stable can watch the film "Earthlings" of 2005 till the end. Plus PETA's live videos. And Instagram videos from slaughterhouses - you name it. This rabbit hole is endless.
              <br />
              <br />Before and nowadays in ingenious cultures in order to kill the animal, the hunter had to stalk him for several hours at the same speed, and in case he managed to get him, he asked for forgiveness before killing the animal knowing that he will be hunted and caught by Death in the very same way. And he thanked the animal for his fur/meat/etc. and treated him with due respect. Besides, the hunter has never killed more animals than he needed for food. 
             Nowadays, "industrial" animals are killed at an enormous scale in various manners without humanity, remorse, thanksfullness for the meat/fur/etc. they provide. They are just regarded as resourse.

                <li>"Cows are amongst the gentlest of breathing creatures; none show more passionate tenderness to their young when deprived of them; and, in short, I am not ashamed to profess a deep love for these quiet creatures."  Thomas de Quincey
</li>
                <li>"I absolutely adore cows. They're the most fascinating, gentle and beautiful animals. Their eyes are so amazing. I have ten that live on the land around my house. I love to talk to them. There are few things better than falling asleep in a field and being woken up by an inquisitive cow."  Mary Quant
</li>
                <li>"There's nothing like sitting back and talking to your cows."  Russell Crowe
</li>
                <li>"I was in a bar in Rio and a cow walked in, I looked into its eyes, and I saw such tranquillidad, serenity. Then I started seeing cows everywhere. I realise why the Indians worship them. " Manu Chao
